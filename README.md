# EMRI_waveforms_in_a_nuthsell

Here [Grappa_tutorial.ipynb] you can find a pedagogical tutorial on creating Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) waveforms. We will make an extensive use of the Fast EMRI Waveform (FEW) package [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). Install the FEW package before running the notebook. The installation instructions can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms). The waveforms in this package combine a variety of separately accessible modules to form EMRI waveforms on both CPUs and GPUs. Generally, the modules fall into four categories: trajectory, amplitudes, summation, and utilities. Please see the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) for further information on these modules. 

If you use all or any parts of this code, please cite [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) and [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). See the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) to properly cite specific modules.
