# GRAPPA_EMRI_tutorial

Here we present a pedagogical tutorial created to go through the the basics of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) waveforms. We will make an extensive use of the Fast EMRI Waveform package [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). The waveforms in this package combine a variety of separately accessible modules to form EMRI waveforms on both CPUs and GPUs. Generally, the modules fall into four categories: trajectory, amplitudes, summation, and utilities. Please see the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) for further information on these modules. The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms). The data necessary for various modules in this package will automatically download the first time it is needed. If you would like to view the data, it can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3981654#.XzS_KRNKjlw). The current and all past code release zip files can also be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4005001).

This package is a part of the [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org/).
